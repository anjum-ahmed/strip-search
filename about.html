<h2>About</h2>
<p>A tool to search the <em>Peanuts</em> comic strips.</p>
<h3>Are there any advanced features?</h3>
<p>
Not yet, but hopefully in the future. The main crux of this tool is to enable myself and others to reference strips at the speed of thought. Focus right now is improving the transcripts and ensuring the searches are fast. I hope to put in features like syntax for advanced querying, search stats, spell checking, and so on.

<h3 id="communities">Communities</h3>
<p>
The fandom online I've often described as <q>disparate</q>: sparse and loosely knit communities, largely unaware of each others' existence. I hope it becomes more unified and coherent one day. Here are some communities:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://reddit.com/r/peanuts"><strong>Reddit r/peanuts</strong></a>&mdash;Link aggregator. Focused on photos of merchandise, fan crafts, and art, all on top of its original purpose, which is to bookmark and comment on relevant news articles and resources. Main attraction is the strip serialized daily. Receptive to literary-focused discussions and lore.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://discord.gg/E6UuDfX"><strong>Discord #peanuts</strong></a>&mdash;Chat room. Very active community, with long, thoughtful discussions over the lore and history of the comic strip and animations, as well as occasionally discussing merchandise and art.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Alukeepplin%20peanuts&f=live"><strong>Twitter @lukeepplin <em>et al</em></strong></a>&mdash;Social media. Easily the most intelligent and literary-focused discussions of the comic strip. Writer Luke Epplin prompts thoughtful discussions about the theological, social, and political aspects of the comic, with other users in the replies pitching in. Other recommended accounts are <a href="https://twitter.com/Peanuts50YrsAgo">@Peanuts50YrsAgo</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SchulzMuseum">@SchulzMuseum</a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/Peanuts-Collector-Club-127941365473"><strong>Facebook Peanuts Collector Club</strong></a>&mdash;Social media. Mostly photos and discussions of figurine collecting, not much discussion about the strip itself. The most long-lived community though, tracing all the way back to a 90s mailing list. Represents the more insular, geriatric portion of the fandom.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://boards.4chan.org/search#/charlie%20brown%20OR%20peppermint%20patty"><strong>4chan /co/</strong></a>&mdash;Imageboard. When threads appear, they're normally dedicated to Peppermint Patty, serving to occasionally discuss the comic strip and animations, sometimes digging deep into character lore and uncovering forgotten arcs of the strip. Threads are archived on <a href="https://desuarchive.org/co/search/text/peppermint%20patty/">Desuarchive</a>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://gocomics.com/peanuts"><strong>GoComics.com Peanuts</strong></a>&mdash;Syndicate website. Every strip in the archive and among the reruns carry a comment section. Every day, where a new strip is added to the rereun, there are a few dozen comments discussing the strip of the day, albeit sometimes tiresomely venturing into US politics. Some users are familiar names, making it a little of bit of a community of its own. 
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Resources</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://peanuts.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Comic_strips"><strong>Fandom.com</strong></a>&mdash;The <em>Peanuts</em> wiki is the best way to read every strip online, they're all organised month-by-month, with a many strips annotated with contextual information.
